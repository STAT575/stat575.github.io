# Course Policies


### Grading Policy
You will earn a letter grade for the class (A,B,C,D,F). Please feel free to talk with me at any time in the semester about where you stand in terms of a grade based on your work up to that point. Please take the work in this class seriously as it reflects on our students, our faculty members, SCRS, and the department.  For most of you this is your first professional gig as a statistician! 

At the end of the semester, you will reflect on your performance in the class and rate yourself on the following criteria and write a paragraph evaluating and reflecting on your performance in the class.   These  will  serve  as  prior  information  for  my  final  assigned  scores.   Then  we  will  meet briefly during finals week to discuss your ratings.

1.  Part  of  learning  to  consult  is  developing  as  a  professional  and  that  involves  attending seminars and other professional development opportunities when they don’t conflict with other activities 
2.  How effective were your handouts and the notes you took during class? 
3.  How meaningful and helpful were your in-class contributions and how often did you participate?
4.  Did you make reasonable progress toward finishing your report in a timely manner?  
5.  How complete and appropriate was your advice and the written report for the client?  
6.  Overall effectiveness of communication (with client, partners, and me)?  

###  Academic Misconduct
Section 420 of the Student Conduct Code describes academic misconduct as including but not limited to plagiarism, cheating, multiple submissions, or facilitating others’ misconduct. Possible sanctions for academic misconduct range from an oral reprimand to expulsion from the university.

### Disabilities Policy

Federal law mandates the provision of services at the university-level to qualified students with disabilities. If you have a documented disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation(s), you are encouraged to contact the Office of Disability Services as soon as possible.

### COVID-19 Information

Face masks will be recommended, but not required, for students, faculty and staff in campus buildings at Montana State University. Face coverings can help slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 via droplets from sneezes, coughs or even talking over distances up to 6 feet. Since people can carry and spread the virus without showing any symptoms of it — or with very mild symptoms — wearing a face covering can help protect those around you and the community at large. Montana State University strongly recommends students, faculty and staff wear face masks in indoor public spaces, in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control recommendations. Montana State University encourages students, faculty and staff to take advantage of convenient, on-campus clinics for the COVID-19 vaccine. Schedule your appointment by going to: www.montana.edu/health/coronavirus.

Please evaluate your own health status regularly and refrain from attending class and other on-campus events if you are ill. MSU students who miss class due to illness will be given opportunities to access course materials online. You are encouraged to seek appropriate medical attention for treatment of illness. In the event of contagious illness, please do not come to class or to campus to turn in work. Instead notify me by email about your absence as soon as practical, so that accommodations can be made. Please note that documentation (a Doctor’s note) for medical excuses is not required. MSU University Health Partners - as part their commitment to maintain patient confidentiality, to encourage more appropriate use of healthcare resources, and to support meaningful dialogue between instructors and students - does not provide such documentation.
